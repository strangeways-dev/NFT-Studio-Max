NFT Studio was created by me - an indie developer - under the name of 'StrangeWays'.
It was created to make the creation of NFT collections cheap and accessible to all, as of now it is completely FREE!

Metadata JSON files are created for your images
Generate one by one and be selective about which to keep/discard
Generate in batches (if you don't like some of the images you can delete them post generation and then use the 'Sweep Collection' function which will fix your images and metadata files by editing their names and the data inside of JSON files, effectively reorganising your collection and filling the gaps you created when you deleted the images)
